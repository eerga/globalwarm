# global warming data exploration

#### In this data, we have daily readings of minimum temperatures from Melbourne, Australia for 10 years (1981-1990). I was curious to see if any global warming trends would be visible on the 10-year scale. The reason for choosing minimum temperatures might not seem obvious, but I decided to play with those in order to observe extreme case of global warming. If minimum temperatures directly indicate presence of glabal warming, then we may need to do something before it is too late. I was also curious to see which of the models commonly used in time series forecasting would perform the best. The source code can be viewed in 3 formats: ipynb, pdf, and HTML.
